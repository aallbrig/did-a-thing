                    <h5>Managing Multiple Calendars</h5>
                    <p>The app supports multiple calendars, allowing you to track different habits or tasks independently. Each calendar has its own color, data, and completion status.</p>

                        <li>Choose a color for the completion dots - you can use the color picker or enter a hex code</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h6>Switching Between Calendars</h6>
                    <p>Use the tabs above the calendar to switch between your different tracking calendars. Each tab shows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A colored dot representing the calendar's completion color</li>
                        <li>The calendar name (truncated with "..." if too long)</li>
                        <li>The active calendar is highlighted</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h6>Deleting a Calendar</h6>
                    <p>Next to the Edit button, you'll find a "Delete" button (üóëÔ∏è). To delete a calendar:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Click the Delete button for the calendar you want to remove</li>

                    <p>On the home page, you'll see a large circular button with "I did it!" text. Click this button to mark today as complete <strong>for the currently active calendar</strong>. When clicked, the button will display a spectacular spinning rainbow border with the calendar's color fill to celebrate your accomplishment!</p>

                    <h5>Tracking Your Progress</h5>

                    <h6>Calendar Interaction</h6>
                    <p>You can interact with the calendar in multiple ways:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Click any day:</strong> Tap or click on any day in the calendar to toggle its completion status</li>
                        <li><strong>Add or remove dots:</strong> Clicking a day will add a colored dot if it wasn't completed, or remove it if it was</li>

                        <li><strong>Visual feedback:</strong> Days light up on hover to show they're clickable</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h6>Understanding the Calendar</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Colored dots:</strong> Days when you successfully did the thing (color matches the active calendar)</li>
                        <li><strong>No dot:</strong> Days when you didn't complete your task</li>
                        <li><strong>Today:</strong> Highlighted with a blue border and special styling</li>
                        <li><strong>Each calendar is independent:</strong> Switching calendars shows different completion data</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h6>Progress Statistics</h6>
                    <p>Below the calendar, you'll see your progress statistics showing:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>7-Day Average:</strong> Your completion percentage for the last 7 days</li>
                        <li><strong>30-Day Average:</strong> Your completion percentage for the last 30 days</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h5>Data Storage</h5>
                    <p>Your progress for all calendars is automatically saved in your browser's local storage. This means your data persists between sessions, but it's only available on the device and browser you're using. Each calendar maintains its own separate tracking data.</p>
